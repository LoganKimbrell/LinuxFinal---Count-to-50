# LinuxFinal---Count-to-50
This is a simple program that counts from 1 to 50 and post's it to the terminal

This used the Nano text editor and I inserted the python language into the file.
This file requires you to have python3 for it to function.
To make it run just use the ./count.py and it'll count from 1 to 50
